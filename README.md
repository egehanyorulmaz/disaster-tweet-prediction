## This repository is focusing on solving the Kaggle Competition, ['Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets'](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started/overview). Although the competition is considered as an easy start for the beginners to NLP, I will be do my best to develop codes in a more clean and structured way instead of following a quick/messy approach and achieve 100% score. If you see a mistake or areas of improvement, I am open to suggestions and I would be happy to talk.
